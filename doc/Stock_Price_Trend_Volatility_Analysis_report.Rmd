# Summary

In this project, we analyze whether there is any association between the volatility of weekly Google Trends[@googletrends] keyword interest of a stock ticker and the volatility of weekly stock returns. We analyze the standard deviation of weekly search trends and weekly returns over a one-year period July 2020 to July 2021 of over 300 stocks in the S&P 500, ultimately finding a small but statistically significant association.

# Introduction

Investment firms are increasingly looking to data science and unusual data sources to provide informational advantages to bolster their portfolio strategies. In this project, we are investigating whether Google Trends data on stock ticker names can provide insight into return volatility. Investors are often interested in understanding the volatility of stock returns. Some financial derivative trading strategies try to take advantage of changes in a stocks' return volatility, as certain options are sensitive to changes in implied volatility.

To cover the basics, the term "stock market" typically refers to one of the major stock market indexes, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the Standard & Poor's 500, which includes 500 of the largest U.S. companies. It is a global network in which individuals can purchase ownership, commonly known as shares, of a public company. Companies will become public when they are listed under a stock exchange where the financial instruments are bought and sold. Moreover, a financial [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp) is a product or contract which typically derives its value from an underlying asset, such as an [option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) on a company's stock. One property of many option derivatives is option [vega](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vega.asp), which generally refers to the sensitivity of the option price to the implied volatility of the underlying. Some derivative trading strategies revolve around benefiting from increases or decreases in the implied volatility of the underlying stock. These properties underscore the motivation for seeking out associations between unusual data sources and return volatility.

This report was compiled using an R markdown document from R[@R] with scripts running via `docopt` package[@docopt]. The data tables are stored as .csv files in [data](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Stock-Price-Trend-Volatility-Analysis/tree/main/data) folder. Intermediate analysis is carrying by using `Pandas`[@mckinney-proc-scipy-2010] package in python[@python]. The final data set that we use for analysis is displayed by using `kable` function in `knitr`[@knitr] package. The results are showing as .png pictures stored in [results](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Stock-Price-Trend-Volatility-Analysis/tree/main/results) folder and is displayed by applying `knitr` as well.

# Methods

## Data

We use Selenium[@selenium] to automate the process of downloading stocks prices from Yahoo Finance[@yahoofinance] and their search interest index from Google Trends. In the src folder, we provide the automation python files that we used to extract and ultimately merge these data sources.

We used Pandas-Profiling[@pandasprofiling2019] to get a first at the original data set. There are 5 features and total 17472 observations with no missing or duplicate values. `weekly_interest` refers to the interest over time data from Google Trends, which is the number of search interests of stocks (symbol variable). This number is relative to the highest point for the given period. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term and a value of 50 means that the term is half as popular, and a score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term. In addition, there are 52 consecutive weeks and 336 different stocks taken into the data set.

Our data cleaning process involved:

-   Converting weekly absolute returns to percent return formats for normalization, which corresponds to the percent return one would have received that week owning the stock

-   Transforming weekly search index values to a percent of total index search values for that stock, which corresponds to a percent of yearly search volume per week

We then take the standard deviation of all of the weekly values by stock, so that our final dataset is one row per stock. The following table is a sample of 10 rows of data which is ultimately used for our analysis. The full data set can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Stock-Price-Trend-Volatility-Analysis/blob/main/data/stocks-prices-trend-volatility.csv).

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
stock_price_trend_volatility_df <- read_csv("../data/processed/stocks-prices-trend-volatility.csv") |> 
  head(10)
kable(stock_price_trend_volatility_df,
      caption = "Table 1. The volatility of stock prices and stock symbol search interests trends(first 10 rows).",
      format = "markdown")
```

## Analysis

In order to assess the inferential question of the association between stock return volatility and search trend volatility, we analyse the standard deviation of weekly search trends and weekly returns for over 300 stocks in the S&P 500 over a one-year period from July 2020 to July 2021. We conduct a simple linear regression (SLR) with a confidence level of 0.95 with the return volatility as the dependent variable and search trends volatility as the independent variable. Our null hypothesis is that there is no association between the two volatilities, with the alternative being that there is an association. Please note that we are not testing causality between the search and price volatility, we only focus on the association. We leave causal analysis for future research. We use $R^2$ to assess how much variation in the data our model is explaining, and use a $p-value$ compared to a 0.05 significance level to decide on whether we may reject the null hypothesis.

The following plot show the distributions of price change volatility and stock search volume volatility for all stocks in the data. We see a right skewed normal shape for price change volatility and more of an exponential distribution for search volume volatility.

```{r fig_1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. Right skewed distribution of volatility for both stock price change and stock symbol searching volume in histogram plots", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/volatility_distribution_plots.png")
```

Now we have the distributions by different sectors(different industries):

```{r fig_2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2. Nearly all distributions of the volatility for both stock price change and stock symbol searching volume by different industries are similar to the overall ones.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/sectors_volatility_distribution_plots.png")
```

Above we plot histograms of the standard deviations of returns and trends of around 330 stocks selected from the S&P500. We broadly observe that within the subsectors, the distribution of volatility is fairly similar to the overall distributions for both return and search volatility.

# Results & Discussion

Here is the statistical regression results:

```{r regression_results_table, echo=FALSE}
cat(read_lines("../results/regression-results.txt"), sep = '\n')
```

In addition, the following two figures are plotted regression results and plotted residuals.

```{r fig_3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 3. Regression result of showing a relationship between stock symbol search and stock weekly return, but with a very low score of R^2", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/regression-plot.png")
```

```{r fig_4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 4. Residuals are not seemingly abnormally distributed.", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/residuals-plot.png")
```

Given that our p-value of 0.027 for our slope coefficient is less than our significance level of 0.05, we find a significant coefficient of trend volatility and reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative. The $R^2$ value of 0.015 indicates that our simple model is explaining very little of the variation in return volatility, but more work needs to be done to assess how this compares to other modelling done in the financial domain. Moreover, the effect size seems to be fairly small in relation to the range of return volatility that we observe in the data, but we leave formal analysis of effect size for future iterations of this project.

Our residual plot demonstrates that our residuals are not seemingly abnormally distributed. We see broad normal distribution around 0 given search volatility, and we do not observe any obvious change in variance or direction of residuals across the plot. This means that it is unlikely we have meaningfully violated regression assumptions.

```{r fig_5, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 5. Various regression results for volatility by sectors (industry fields), the plot of Communication Services shows strong relationship and the plots of some other sectors even show negative relationships.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/sectors_stocks_prices_searchvols_reg.png")
```

Comparing across sectors, while the histogram distributions of volatility of searches and returns seemed fairly similar to the overall distribution, it seems as if the same notion does not hold for the association between variables. Some sectors, such as communication services, seem to have a much stronger relationship than utilities, while some sectors even display a negative relationship. It must be noted that since we slice up our data considerably to perform this analysis, we should expect more sampling variation. Thus, we do not formally analyse our data by sector but leave this for future iterations of the project where we can hopefully collect more data.

# Limitations & Future Research

Our limitations include the fact that we have one year of data and stocks are selected from one index only. Our analysis thus applies to this time frame and stock pool and it is unclear whether the relationship would be robust across different time periods or stock pools. Moreover, with respect to time, financial analysis done in industry is often performed in a time series manner. The weekly nature of our data may have some underlying non-linearity, such as seasonal changes. Moreover, there may be delay effects between trend and return volatility. The impacts of the potential non-linearity may have unknown impacts on the reliability of our analysis. Given our analytical and capacity limitations, we leave a time series analysis of this relationship for future research.

Additionally we have limited features in a simple linear regression. Therefore, a logical next step may be to expand our feature set. For example, while we use searched stock tickers for this EDA, we can perhaps use the company names or other adjacent searches in a multivariate regression for our volatility analysis.

It must be noted again that our simple model is explaining very little of the variation in return volatility. This caveat is to be expected considering we are using a very simple model to understand markets which contain lots of complexity.

Ultimately, this positive result is exciting and warrants future investigation into the use of Google Trends for Financial Analysis.
